# Module 3 Challenge
In this Challenge, Ill be taking on the role of an analyst at a high-tech investment firm. The vice president (VP) of my department is considering arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin trades on markets across the globe. I looked through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase. I will apply the three phases of financial analysis to determine if any arbitrage opportunities exist for Bitcoin. I will be refering to the following csv files 'bitstamp.csv' and 'coinbase.csv'.using a jupyter notebook.

This aspect of the Challenge will consist of 3 phases.

1. Collect the data.

2. Prepare the data.

3. Analyze the data.
